# Potential-of-Vision-Transformer-in-Leukemia-Detection

## Abstract 

Leukemia, a bone marrow-related disease, arises from the abnormal proliferation of cells. It is the predominant form of childhood cancer, representing about one-third of cases annually. This study focuses on incorporating AI models to enhance the early detection of Leukemia. A public dataset is employed for testing purposes which comprises of 15,114 images in total. Advancing the field, this research employs vision transformer techniques, previously unexplored in leukemia detection, showing promising efficiency for such applications. Emphasizing the critical role of precision in medical imaging, particularly in the context of Leukemia detection, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
